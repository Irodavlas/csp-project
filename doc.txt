Cd and Ls command for client 



Commands that fit your current protocol:

cd <path> ✓ — Already works
ls <path> ✓ — Already works (sends FileEntry structs)
create <path> <perms> ✓ — TEXT response only
chmod <path> <perms> ✓ — TEXT response only
move <path1> <path2> ✓ — TEXT response only
delete <path> ✓ — TEXT response only

Commands that need binary payload:

read <path> — Need to send file content as binary payload
write <path> — Client sends file content as binary payload
upload <path> — Client sends file as binary payload
download <path> — Server sends file as binary payload

Your protocol should be:
[msg_header: type, status, payloadLength]
[payload data - can be text or binary]
For file transfers, you can reuse your structure:

read: Server sends FILERES header with payloadLength = file_size, then the file bytes
write: Client sends FILEUPLOAD header with payloadLength = file_size, then file bytes
upload/download: Same pattern
